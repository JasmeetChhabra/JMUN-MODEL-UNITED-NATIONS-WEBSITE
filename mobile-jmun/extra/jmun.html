<p>JMUN turns five this year. With the success of JMUN 2014 still running in our

veins, and as all good things come to an end, so did this. But, the end is just a beginning

to another story.</p>

<p>The Secretariat is all prepared to make sure that this year JMUN 2015 turns out to

be bigger, better and more enriching !</p>

<p>This year JMUN 2015 is going to focus on issues which plague the world, issues

which are deeply rooted, and issues which are grave and heinous in nature. We call

the contemplating youth to deliberate on such matters and pave a new way that will

lead us out of the chaos and cacophony amidst which we find ourselves day in and

day out. We realize we are forcing the coming generations to live under a rule of

‘taxation without representation’ as each day we continue to extract humanity and

morality from every corner of the world.</p>

<p> Call the contemplating youth to deliberate on such matters and pave a new way

<p> Secretariat knows and believes that change cannot happen overnight but only

if we take one step at a time. Model United Nations is our very small step towards

inheriting our future and making our destiny. It may not change the world but it

will change a person, it will change you.</p>

<p>The secretariat is working out the best possible accommodation and services for

our delegates. Keep watching the space for more updates as we move forward

towards our final destination.</p>

<p>We are more than honoured to invite each one of you to JMUN 2015 from the 7th

to the 8th of February 2015.</p>

<p>Lets stand up once again to make a difference !
