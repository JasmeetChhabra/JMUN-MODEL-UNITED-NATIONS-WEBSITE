				<h1>Letter From Secretary General</h1><br/>

				<h2>Dear prospective delegates, faculty advisors and well-wishers</h2><br/>
				<span style="font-size:15px; color:#E7E7E7" >	<p>With immense pleasure, I welcome you to Jaypee Model United Nations Conference. JMUN’15 shall be an experience different from other MUNs in the quality of the conference and debate that has been progressively on a decline in Model United Nations Conferences. Starting from the application format itself, participating in this MUN will be a rigorous, intellectually challenging and extremely competitive experience which is a throwback to the earlier generations of MUN Conferences.</p><p>

					The JMUN team this year is made up of innovative, intelligent and creative people that have strived and worked hard to bring you what we believe will be a unique and meaningful conference for you - the delegates. With the help of our advisors and organizers who brought you JMUN’14 in addition to the new blood of our very own hand-picked JMUN'15 team, we have managed to synergise both the old and the new that will surely surprise you all. I personally could not have asked for a better team than the team members that I have now.</p><p>

					I call upon every enthusiastic delegate to come and experience a life changing conference. Be part of the JMUN family, a community of future young leaders. Come and learn about the International Relations, geo-Politics, public speaking, and diplomacy and also make friendships that go beyond your community or institute. I hope JMUN can be a platform to reflect on the roles of leadership and the power of young people to make a difference. I welcome you, future young leaders to be a part of the JMUN family and I encourage you to submit your application.</p><p>

					Until then, please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions, comments, or concerns.  I look forward to meeting you all in February- ready and prepared for what is to be a very unique MUN experience that all of you will treasure.</p>
					<p>
					Sincerely,<br>
					Sambhav Jain
