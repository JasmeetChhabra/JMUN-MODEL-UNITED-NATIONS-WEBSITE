				<h2>NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL</h2><br/>
				<span style="font-size:15px; color:#E7E7E7">	<p>The National Security Council of India is the apex agency looking into the country's political, economic, energy and strategic security concerns. It was established by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government on 19 November 1998, with Brajesh Mishra as the first National Security Advisor. Besides the National Security Adviser (NSA), the Ministers of Defence, External Affairs, Home, Finance of the Government of India, and the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission are members of the National Security Council. Other members may be invited to attend its monthly meetings, as and when required.</p>
<p>The three-tiered structure of the NSC comprises the Strategic Policy Group, the National Security Advisory Board and a Secretariat represented by the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC). Since its inception the NSC has overseen several crisis situations from the Kargil War to IC-814 hijacking and Mumbai Attacks. The current agency executive of NSC is Ajit Kumar Doval.</p>
<p>The NSC at JMUN’15 will be a historical simulation where we discuss the national security after the horrors of Mumbai and the fate of the highly controversial AFSPA.
